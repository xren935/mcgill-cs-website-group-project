<p>Computer science encompasses everything from theory to applications, including software engineering, programming languages, robotics, compilers, databases, game design and development, operating systems, artificial intelligence, computational biology, computer vision, and the analysis of algorithms.</p>\n                  <h2>Studying Computer Science at McGill</h2>\n                  <p>You can study Computer Science at McGill in many different ways. One typical way is by completing a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree program in the <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/science/\">Faculty of Science</a>. You can choose the amount and nature of the computer science courses that you take by selecting different program options. For example, a Major in Computer Science requires you to take 60 credits of computer science or related courses. On the other hand, a Minor in Computer Science requires you to take only 24 credits of computer science or related courses. Most computer science courses are worth 3 or 4 credits.</p>\n                  <h2>The School of Computer Science</h2>\n                  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/\">School of Computer Science</a> is part of the <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/science/\">Faculty of Science</a>. The School of Computer Science groups 34 faculty members who teach and do research on a wide variety of computer science and software engineering topics. The School of Computer Science is located in the <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/facilities/buildings/mcconnell\">McConnell Engineering</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/facilities/buildings/lm-trottier\">Trottier</a> Buildings. Courses at McGill are taught in English. For most upper-level computer science courses, classes are small (about 10-30 students), and students have numerous opportunities for direct interaction with professors, both inside and outside the classroom.</p>\n                  <h2>Our Undergraduate Programs</h2>\n                  <p>The School of Computer Science offers several interesting study programs. Our three most popular programs are:</p>\n                  <li>Major in Computer Science, for students interested in a broad study of computer science topics.</li>     \n                  <li>Major in Software Engineering, for students interested in problems related to the design, development, and maintenance of software systems.</li>\n                  <li>Minor in Computer Science, for students interested in a computer science complement to another major field of study.</li>\n                  <p>Other programs that combine the study of computer science with different topics are also offered by other departments in the Faculty of Science and in the Faculty of Arts. For more details, see the complete list of programs offered by the School of Computer Science.</p>\n                  <p>If you're lost, feel free to <a href=\"#\">contact us</a>. McGill computer science students also have access to an internship program.</p>\n                  <h2>Why You Should Apply?</h2>\n                  <p>A university-level education in computer science will help you develop your analytical thinking and creative problem solving skills while studying a wealth of exciting topics with a wide range of applications (from medicine to business). An undergraduate education in computer science will also open the door to careers in a variety of companies (engineering, high-tech, pharmaceutical). For those of you who may be thinking about graduate studies, a degree in computer science is an excellent foundation for the study of computer science at the graduate level (M.Sc. or Ph.D.). McGill is a <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-canada\">top-ranked and internationally-recognized university</a>, and our graduates typically move on to fulfilling careers or further studies in the top companies or universities.</p>\n                  <hr></hr>                        \n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        }\n      </Spring>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ProspectiveWhyCS;\n\nclass ScrollToTopOnMount extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 600);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
